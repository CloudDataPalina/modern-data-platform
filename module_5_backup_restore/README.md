# Module 5 – Database Backup, Restore & Automation

## 📌 Module Overview
This module focuses on **database backup, restore, and automation techniques**.
It demonstrates how to protect data from unexpected loss by creating reliable backups, restoring databases after failures, and automating backup processes to improve operational efficiency.

The module consists of **two practical labs**:
1. Manual database backup and restore
2. Automated backup, retention, and recovery using Bash and CRON

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Perform database backup and restore operations
- Apply best practices for data protection and recovery
- Automate database maintenance tasks
- Schedule recurring backup jobs
- Simulate data loss and recover databases from backups

- MySQL CLI – Manual backup and restore
- Bash – Automation scripting
- CRON – Job scheduling
- gzip – Backup compression
- Docker / Cloud IDE (IBM Skills Network Labs) – Execution environment

## Lab 1 – Manual Database Backup & Restore
### Description
This lab demonstrates how to **manually protect and recover database data** using MySQL command-line tools.
A backup of the `FactSales` table is created, data loss is simulated by dropping the table, and the table is fully restored from the backup file.

### Key Activities
- Create a backup of a MySQL table using `mysqldump`
- Simulate data loss by dropping the table
- Restore the table from a backup file
- Validate data integrity after recovery

### 📄 Commands Used
 - Command list:
  - [`backup_command.txt`](lab_1_backup_restore/commands/backup_command.txt)
  - [`drop_table_command.txt`](lab_1_backup_restore/commands/drop_table_command.txt)
  - [`restore_command.txt`](lab_1_backup_restore/commands/restore_command.txt)


### 🧪 Validation & Evidence
- Backup creation, table drop, and restore proof:
  - [`screenshots/`](lab_1_backup_restore/screenshots/)

## Lab 2 – Automated Backup & Recovery
### Description
This lab focuses on **automating database backup and restore operations**.
A Bash script is created to generate compressed backups at regular intervals, enforce a retention policy, and restore the database after a simulated data loss.

### Key Activities
- Create an automated backup Bash script
- Compress backups and store them with timestamps
- Configure CRON to execute backups every 3 minutes
- Implement backup retention (10 days)
- Simulate data loss and restore the database from the latest backup

### 📄 Scripts & Commands
- Automated backup script:
  - [`backup_automation.sh`](lab_2_backup_automation/scripts/backup_automation.sh)
- Data loss simulation script:
  - [`truncate_tables.sh`](lab_2_backup_automation/scripts/truncate_tables.sh)
- Cron scheduling commands:
  - [`cron_job.txt`](lab_2_backup_automation/cron/cron_job.txt)


### 🧪 Validation & Evidence
- Automation execution, cron jobs, and data restoration proof:
  - [`screenshots/`](lab_2_backup_automation/screenshots/)

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
