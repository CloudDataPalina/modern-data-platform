# Module 5 – Database Optimization, Security & Access Control

## 📌 Module Overview
This module focuses on **database performance optimization, security, and access control**.
It demonstrates how a Database Administrator improves query efficiency, reduces memory usage, enforces role-based access control, and protects sensitive data through encryption.

The module consists of **two practical labs**:
1. Database and query optimization
2. User access management and data encryption

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Optimize SQL queries using indexes and execution plans
- Analyze query performance with `EXPLAIN`
- Reduce memory usage by optimizing data types
- Execute table optimization commands
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Apply column-level security
- Encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using AES encryption

## Lab 1 – Database & Query Optimization
### Description
This lab demonstrates how to **improve database performance and efficiency**.
Query execution is analyzed before and after indexing, memory usage is optimized by adjusting data types, and table optimization commands are applied.

### Key Activities
- Execute SQL queries with and without indexes
- Analyze execution plans using `EXPLAIN`
- Create indexes to improve query performance
- Optimize column data types to reduce memory usage
- Execute `OPTIMIZE TABLE` to improve table efficiency

### 📄 Commands Used
- Optimization commands:
  - [`optimization_commands.sql`](lab_1_optimization/commands/optimization_commands.sql)

### 🧪 Validation & Evidence
- Query performance comparison and memory optimization proof:
  - [`screenshots/`](lab_1_optimization/screenshots/)

## Lab 2 – Access Control & Data Encryption
### Description
This lab focuses on **database security and controlled access management**.
Multiple database users are created with different privilege levels, and sensitive sales data is protected using AES encryption.

### Key Activities
- Create database users with role-based permissions
- Assign full, limited, read-only, and column-level access
- Restrict access to sensitive columns
- Encrypt sensitive data using AES encryption
- Query encrypted data with and without decryption keys

### 📄 Commands Used
- Security and encryption commands:
  - [`security_commands.sql`](lab_2_security/commands/security_commands.sql)

### 🧪 Validation & Evidence
- User privileges and encryption verification:
  - [`screenshots/`](lab_2_security/screenshots/)
